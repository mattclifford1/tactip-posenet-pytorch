Tested with python 3.8 / 3.9 and pytorch 1.11

## Currently under development - let me know if you find any bugs!
TODO:
  - documentation
  - hyperopt
  - digitac compatibility
  - figure out why with RELU it does not train
  - digitac data loader/saving scheme
  - make data loading scheme more generic
    - document expected data structure
